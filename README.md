# Studio-II-Replacement-ROM
RCA Studio II Replacement ROM

This is a project to build a replacement EPROM for the Studio II.  
The Studio II does not use standard ROM's, so a dedicated circuit is required to interface a Standard EPROM to it.
Enclosed is the KiCad design files, PCB Gerber files and an assembly manual with BOM.
